Clone your Weather App Repository:
Make sure you have the code for your React weather app on your local machine. If you've been working with a version control system like Git, you can clone the repository. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store your project. Then run:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
Install Dependencies:
Navigate to your project folder using the terminal/command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

Run the Application:
After the dependencies are installed, you can run your React app with the following command:

npm start
This will start a development server and open your app in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Using the App:
In your web browser, you should now see your weather app. You can type a city name into the input field and click the submit button to get weather details.

Stopping the App:
To stop the development server, you can press Ctrl + C in the terminal/command prompt where your app is running. This will stop the server and the app won't be accessible in the browser anymore.
